## Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

We accept pull requests for bug fixes and small features where the approach will be simple and straightforward. We'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.

We track issues on our project board [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues).

Please do:

- Check existing issues to verify that the bug or feature request has not already been submitted.
- Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
- Open an issue to propose a significant change.
- Open a pull request to fix a bug.
- If you're contributing for the first time here, try and look for any issues labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/labels/good%20first%20issue).

Please avoid:

- Opening pull requests for issues marked `Status: Design Needed`, `Status: To Be Discussed`, or `Status: Need Exploration`.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:
