## Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

We accept pull requests for bug fixes and small features where the approach will be simple and straightforward. We'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.

We track issues on our project board [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/issues).

Please do:

- Check existing issues to verify that the bug or feature request has not already been submitted.
- Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
- Open an issue to propose a significant change.
- Open a pull request to fix a bug.
- If you're contributing for the first time here, try and look for any issues labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/contribute).

Please avoid:

- Opening pull requests for issues marked `Status: Design Needed`, `Status: To Be Discussed`, or `Status: Need Exploration`.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Make the changes in your code locally. [Check setup instructions here](/readme.md).
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests and local builds still pass
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/pulls).
   - Please ensure your PR title matches the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
1. One you submit a pull request, you will receive an automated reply from the [CLA bot](https://github.com/apps/cla-bot) asking you to sign a Contributor License Agreement.
   - After signing once, please wait for sometime (about 1 day) for the team to authorize your CLA check.
   - Read more about a CLA Agreement [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Format your code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
