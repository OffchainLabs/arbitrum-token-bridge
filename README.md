## Prerequisites for running the code

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform
- Install [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) to setup the correct Node version for the project.
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your platform
- Install [Yarn (version 1)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) - Package manager

- Within VS Code, we use a some tools to automate things (e.g. code formatting), maintain consistency and reduce noise for code reviews. For the optimal development experience, install the following tools:

  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - Automatic code formatting
    - Find Prettier integration for your code editor [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
  - [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) - Automatic file formatting
    - Find EditorConfig integration for your code editor [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download)
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - Static analysis for JavaScript
    - Find ESLint integration for your code editor [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/integrations#editors)

## Steps to run the code locally

1. Clone the Arbitrum token bridge repository from Github onto your local machine

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-bridge
   ```

2. Use the Node version as per project settings to avoid any errors before project installation.

   ```bash
   $ nvm use
   ```

3. Install dependencies in all packages using yarn.

   ```bash
   $ yarn
   ```

4. Set env vars:

   1. Copy the existing env.local.sample file present.

      ```bash
      $ cp ./packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.env.local.sample  ./packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.env
      ```

   2. In `.env` created, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_KEY=my-infura-key`

   3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` to your WalletConnect project ID. You can create a new project on the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app).

   4. For custom urls, set optional vars:

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=my-eth-node`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=my-sepolia-node`
     (see [.env.sample](./packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.env.sample))
     If no custom URL is provided, Infura will be used by default.

5. Build the project and internal packages

   ```bash
   $ yarn build
   ```

6. Finally, running the project

   1. (back in root dir:)

      ```bash
      $ yarn dev
      ```

   2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

## Testing changes

It is important for any code change to pass both unit and end-to-end tests. This is generally done before raising the PR to ensure it doesn't break any existing feature.

<br />

### Run Unit Tests

1. Run the token bridge UI locally on `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Run the tests
   ```bash
   $ yarn test:ci
   ```

<br />

### Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests

1. Set up the Nitro test node

   1. First, make sure you have a Nitro test node running. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node).

      Use the following command to run your test nodes locally for our tests. You may omit `--l3node --l3-token-bridge` if you don't intend on testing Orbit chains.

      ```bash
      ./test-node.bash --init --no-simple --tokenbridge --l3node --l3-token-bridge
      ```

      To run with a custom fee token also include the following flags:

      ```bash
      --l3-fee-token --l3-fee-token-decimals 18
      ```

   2. When the Nitro test-node is up and running you should see logs like `sequencer_1` and `staker-unsafe_1` in the terminal. This can take up to 10 minutes.

2. At the root of the token bridge UI:

   1. Run:

   ```bash
   $ cp ./packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.e2e.env.sample ./packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.e2e.env
   ```

   2. In the newly created file, `.e2e.env`, update your `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY_USER`

3. Run the token bridge UI locally on `http://localhost:3000/` with:

   ```bash
   $ yarn dev
   ```

4. Run e2e tests

   ```bash
   $ yarn test:e2e
   ```

5. If you would like to run CCTP tests, run

   ```bash
   $ yarn test:e2e:cctp
   ```

6. For Orbit tests, run

   ```bash
   $ yarn test:e2e:orbit
   ```
