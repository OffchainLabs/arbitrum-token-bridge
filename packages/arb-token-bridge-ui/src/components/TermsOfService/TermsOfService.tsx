        Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration
      </h3>
      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
      </h3>
      <h5>a. Agreement to Arbitrate </h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in
        these Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that
        any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you
        and Offchain Labs, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of
        Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any
        advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between
        us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
        rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration
        Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims
        court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does
        not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
        state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek
        relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these
        Terms of Service, you and Offchain Labs are each waiving the right to a
        trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
        determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal
        Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
        Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <h5>
        b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
        Non-Individualized Relief
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        YOU AND OFFCHAIN LABS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
        OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
        IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS
        BOTH YOU AND OFFCHAIN LABS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
        CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
        OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR
        CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING
        MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE
        INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
        PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT
        THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC
        INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE
        ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.{' '}
      </p>
      <h5>c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Offchain Labs is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
        efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to
        the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
        info@offchainlabs.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who
        intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
        mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Offchain
        Labs should be sent to 252 Nassau Street, Floor 2, Princeton, New Jersey
        08542 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and
        basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
        sought. If Offchain Labs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty
        (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Offchain Labs
        may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
        amount of any settlement offer made by Offchain Labs or you will not be
        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the
        amount, if any, to which you or Offchain Labs is entitled.
      </p>
      <h5>d. Arbitration Procedures</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
        the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures,
        including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA
        Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
        the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about
        the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s
        consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any
        inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
        Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration
        Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the
        application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not
        result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
        follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All
        issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to
        the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
        Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
        streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator
        can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
        court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and
        applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
        may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unless Offchain Labs and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
        will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties
        with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
        circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
        determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
        Offchain Labs agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
        conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
        through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established
        by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing
        will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which
        the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned
        written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based.
      </p>
      <h5>e. Costs of Arbitration</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
        (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA
        Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the
        value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Offchain
        Labs will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is
        more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that
        you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees
        or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should
        not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Offchain
        Labs will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate
        to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
        compared to the costs of litigation, Offchain Labs will pay as much of
        the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
        arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees
        will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <h5>f. Confidentiality</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
        award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit
        of all parties.
      </p>
      <h5>g. Severability</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
        Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled
        “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
        Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
        such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
        enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
        invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration
        Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the
        arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above
        titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
        Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the
        entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless
        such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with
        respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these
        Terms of Service will continue to apply.
      </p>
      <h5>h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary,
        Offchain Labs agrees that if it makes any future change to this
        Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while
        you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending
        Offchain Labs written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the
        change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future
        change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us
        in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the
        date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any
        subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">User Disputes</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any
        other user in connection with the Service, and Offchain Labs will have
        no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Offchain Labs
        reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way
        with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">General</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by
        reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and
        Offchain Labs governing your access and use of the Service, and
        supersede any prior agreements between you and Offchain Labs with
        respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
        conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party
        content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed
        by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of
        law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
        arbitration, as set forth above, you and Offchain Labs submit to the
        personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
        located within New York, New York. The failure of Offchain Labs to
        exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service
        will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
        provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
        court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
        reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of
        Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of
        any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
        out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must
        be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
        or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of
        any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
        administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of
        Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
        business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
        printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the
        prior written consent of Offchain Labs, but Offchain Labs may assign or
        transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without
        restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
        convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in
        these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and
        variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
        rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
        Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service
        may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or
        other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the
        Service. Offchain Labs will not be in default hereunder by reason of any
        failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such
        failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic,
        hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of
        God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical
        power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes
        beyond Offchain Labs’ reasonable control.

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">U.S. Government Restricted Rights</h3>
